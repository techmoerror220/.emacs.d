Ado-mode for emacs v. 23 and higher
-----------------------------------

This is the readme file for the ado-mode major mode made for editing Stata
files nicely within emacs. It is designed for Stata 15.1, though it is
useful for any version of Stata. It works fine in emacs version 25. It
should work in earlier versions, but this has not been tested well.

Ado-mode provides the following useful features:
. Context sensitive highlighting (aka font-locking) of Stata commands and
common constructions within Stata.
. Smart indentation based on nesting of blocks. This makes the code more
readable and catches forgotten closing braces, parens, and the like.
. Templates for documenting .ado files with Stata help files in pretty much
the same format as used by StataCorp for its documentation.
. Puts timestamps on files as they are saved to keep life easy for
comparing versions.

The mode is customizable both globally via emacs' customize command, as
well as buffer-locally via menus.

The installation instructions are at

Some Extra Files:
----------------

The syntax_testers folder has some files good for checking results,
intended or otherwise, of fiddling with the ado-mode.el file. They
contain pretty much all the commands which appear in the Stata
manuals.  

If You Keep Getting Errors:
--------------------------

If you install the software and keep getting errors, specifically 
"Symbol's function definition is void: line-number-at-pos"
add the following to your .emacs file:
(require 'ado-hacks)
It is a small file which includes the definition of line-number-at-pos from
emacs 22.0.50.1.

Disclaimers:
-----------

You can use this to write ado, do, help, dialog, and mata files for versions of Stata earlier than version 15.1, but it will highlight as though the files were for Stata version 15.1.

I would seriously doubt that the ado-mode works with xemacs.

Use as you please, but abide by the GNU Public License (GPL).

To see what has changed and what should change in the future, see the
changes.md or changes.txt file.

Let me know if you have ideas for improvement.

Enjoy!
