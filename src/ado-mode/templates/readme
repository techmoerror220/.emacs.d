There are some general rules about templates, if you would like to
use ado-new-generic to fill them in partially: 

All files are assumed to contain either at least two *! lines or none.

The first *! (if any) should look like
*! version a.b.c 
where a.b.c is the default first value you would like. There must be
a space after the a.b.c.

The second *! should be
*! 
with a trailing space. This is where the purpose of the file gets put.

If the name of the file is needed somewhere in the file (such as for
ado-files or for autologging do-files), put in 
  putNameHere
everywhere the name should go.

So that ado-mode knows where to start editing, put a
  startHere
in the file. If this is missing, the mode will start at the top of the
file. 

As a side note: there are many extra .blp files which were useful 15
or more years ago. I have not removed them because there could be
someone that still uses them.
