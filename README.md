## My emacs dot files

In the main, this is simply a copy of the wonderful [Emacs Starter Kit for the Social Sciences](https://github.com/kjhealy/emacs-starter-kit) by the great and only [Kieran Healy](https://kieranhealy.org/) who, in turn, derived it from the equally great [Phil Hagelberg's](https://github.com/technomancy) and
[Eric Schulte's](https://github.com/eschulte/) originals.

## Motivation
I Kieran Healy uses Mac OS, I use Debian... Also, I wanted support for the =mu4e= mail reader and other goodies such as better Python support. And I want the emacs.d files synchronized between my office computer and my laptop. Hence this repo.
